# String Calculator (TDD Assignment)

This project is a simple implementation of a String Calculator following the principles of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.  
It was created as part of the Incubyte take-home assignment.

## ðŸ§ª TDD Approach

The implementation strictly follows the TDD cycle:
1. Write a failing test (Red)
2. Write minimal code to pass the test (Green)
3. Refactor the code while keeping all tests green

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Jest (for testing)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhargav00708/string-calculator-tdd.git
   cd string-calculator-tdd
